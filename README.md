# april 22-26:
this week I have spent most of my time pondering how I can even fix my code as nothing seems to be working to create a animation that simulations the downward motion of a object on a slope. I have even asked AI to give me an example of how a falling about get would be simulated and from their I would be able to use the example to expand apon it but I have ran into a new problem the contrains of the X and Y values this has made me contanplate most of deicies but I have to maintain hope that I will be able to finish this project. So I have decied that changing the programming language and application would be the best course of action I can find new videos that Can teach me the nesseary libaries to achive my goal.
