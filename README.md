# april 22-26:
this week I have spent most of my time pondering how I can even fix my code as nothing seems to be working to create a animation that simulations the downward motion of a object on a slope. I have even asked AI to give me an example of how a falling about get would be simulated and from their I would be able to use the example to expand on it but I have ran into a new problem the contrains of the X and Y values this has made me contemplate most of deities but I have to maintain hope that I will be able to finish this project. So I have decided that changing the programming language and application would be the best course of action I can find new videos that Can teach me the necessary libraries to achive my goal.

# april 29 - 3May 

I have successfully moved myself onto vs code using Python now I have to create the code within pygame and using object classes and a Video that I found on YouTube I should be able to create the simulation that I have been planning for. Next week I need to work a lot on the code to even expand apon the video and the code that I being used.
