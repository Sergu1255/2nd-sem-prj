# april 22-26:
this week I have spent most of my time pondering how I can even fix my code as nothing seems to be working to create an animation that simulations the downward motion of an object on a slope. I have even asked AI to give me an example of how a falling about would be simulated and from there I would be able to use the example to expand on it but I have run into a new problem the constraints of the X and Y values this has made me contemplate most of the deities but I have to maintain hope that I will be able to finish this project. Changing the programming language and application would be the best course of action I can find new videos that Can teach me the necessary libraries to achieve my goal.

# april 29 - 3 May 

I have successfully moved onto vs code using Python now I have to create the code within pygame and using object classes and a Video that I found on YouTube I should be able to create the simulation that I have been planning for. Next week I need to work a lot on the code to even expand on the video and the code that I am using.


# May 6 - 10
This week I successfully worked as I was able to create code that uses gravity and friction the issue that I still have to create a collision on the slope. However I have found a video that explains how to make one, but it uses movement from a platformer. [here](Masson_slope.py) is the code I have created a new class and fixed some of the code like Wall_list to make it easier to use.


# May 13 - 17

Throughout this week I have been working on creating a new object that will be used for my project this being a square mass this is important as in most of the objects that are presented within physics the mass is presented as a square. Although I have very little time to complete my project hopefully I will be able to finish by the weekend and hopefully get the slope fully functional. this can be seen within [here](Masson_slope.py) underlines 107
